# Original bugs (rewrite)

The classic `crimsonland.exe` has a few behaviors that look like genuine bugs
once you read the decompile and trace their gameplay impact.

In the rewrite, we fix these **by default**. For parity work and future
differential testing, you can re-enable them with `--preserve-bugs`.

## 1) Bonus drop suppression: `amount == current weapon id`

Native behavior:

- In `bonus_try_spawn_on_kill` (`0x0041f8d0`), after spawning a bonus, the exe
  clears the spawned entry if either:
  - there’s already another bonus of the same `bonus_id` on the ground (duplicate
    suppression), or
  - `bonus.amount == player1.weapon_id` **regardless of bonus type**.

Why it’s likely a bug:

- For non-weapon bonuses, `amount` is usually the bonus metadata “default
  amount”, which lives in a different integer domain than weapon ids.
- This creates accidental “hard bans” where certain bonuses never drop while
  holding specific weapons, and it can also reduce the overall drop rate (the
  drop is canceled, not rerolled).

Examples of the accidental hard bans (native metadata):

- `Reflex Boost` (`amount=3`) while holding `Shotgun` (`weapon_id=3`)
- `Fire Bullets` (`amount=4`) while holding `Sawed-off Shotgun` (`weapon_id=4`)
- `Freeze` (`amount=5`) while holding `Submachine Gun` (`weapon_id=5`)
- `Shield` (`amount=7`) while holding `Mean Minigun` (`weapon_id=7`)
- `Speed` (`amount=8`) while holding `Flamethrower` (`weapon_id=8`)
- `Weapon Power Up` / `MediKit` (`amount=10`) while holding `Multi-Plasma` (`weapon_id=10`)

Rewrite behavior:

- Default: only suppress `Weapon` drops that match the current weapon id.
- With `--preserve-bugs`: re-enable the exe’s `amount == weapon_id` suppression
  rule for all bonus types.
