# Weapons and behavior

This stub page tracks player-facing weapon behavior.

## Current coverage plan

- Damage, fire cadence, and spread semantics by weapon.
- Unlock availability and weapon selection constraints.
- Ammo/dual-weapon and temporary interaction behavior.

## Pending details

- Per-weapon edge cases that affect speed, animation, or projectile routing.
