# Quest mode

This stub page tracks quest-mode player-facing behavior.

## Current coverage plan

- Quest selection and unlock gate flow.
- Build/spawn scripts and quest progression semantics.
- Quest timer and objective completion behavior.
- Per-mode reward and unlock side effects.

## Pending details

- Exact rule differences versus Survival/Rush in pacing and RNG behavior.
- Cross-player outcome and death-state behavior.
