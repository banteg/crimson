# Systems

Behavioral system docs intended for gameplay truth and design-level understanding.

- [Combat](../combat/index.md) — weapon handling, shooting flow, damage/death.
- [Perks](../perks.md)
- [Secret weapons](../secret-weapons.md)
- [Bonuses](bonuses.md)

Decompiler-heavy system internals live in
[RE static systems analysis](../../re/static/systems/index.md).
