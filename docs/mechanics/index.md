# Mechanics

Canonical gameplay behavior, written as the source of truth for how Crimsonland actually plays.

This section avoids rewrite internals and decompiler implementation details where possible.

## Subsections

- [Modes](modes/index.md) — mode-level behavior and mode IDs.
- [Systems](systems/index.md) — gameplay systems like perks and UI behavior.
- [Reference](reference/index.md) — IDs, tables, and lookup documentation used by mechanics pages.
- [Secret weapons](secret-weapons.md) — hidden weapons outside normal quest progression.

## Related sections

- [Reverse engineering](../re/index.md) — static/runtime evidence.
- [Verification](../verification/index.md) — parity and differential testing links.
